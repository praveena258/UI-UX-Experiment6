## Output:
1. Solution Ideation: Crazy 8s Exercise
Problem: Booking an appointment in a hospital app is confusing and takes too many steps.
Crazy 8s Ideation
(8 quick, low-fidelity ideas sketched in short time bursts)
1. One-Tap Booking – Big “Book Appointment” button on the homepage.
2. Voice Assistant – Book appointments using voice commands.
3. Calendar View – Tap on date and choose available slots directly.
4. Specialist Shortcuts – Icons for specialties (e.g., Cardio, Ortho) for quick access.
5. Favorites – Save preferred doctors for faster booking.
6. Symptom Search – Describe symptom and get doctor suggestions.
7. Auto Fill – Use saved patient details for instant form fill.
8. Emergency Button – Quick-call feature for urgent help.
These ideas are very rough and early-stage but help brainstorm potential UX solutions.
2. Creating User Stories
Personas Used
● Aarti, 32, working mother
● Ravi, 60, heart patient
● Meena, 22, college student
User Stories:
1. As a working mother, I want to book an appointment in under 2 minutes, so that I
can manage my time better.
2. As a senior citizen, I want to see only relevant doctors for my condition, so that I
don’t get confused by too many choices.
3. As a student, I want to see doctors available on weekends, so that I don’t miss my
college classes.
4. As a regular patient, I want to save my favorite doctors, so that I don’t have to
search every time.
5. As a first-time user, I want to get guided help for booking, so that I feel confident
using the app.
3. Creating Scenarios
Selected User Story:

Environment: During her lunch break at school, she tries to book a pediatrician appointment.
Emotional State: Stressed due to time pressure and worried about her child’s health.
Tasks:
● Opens app → Logs in → Navigates to pediatrics → Finds doctor → Checks time slots →
Books an appointment → Gets confirmation
Challenges:
● She struggles with slow loading time and many unnecessary steps.
● A simpler UI or quicker access would reduce her stress.
